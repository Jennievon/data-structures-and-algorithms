## Task

The variables integer, double, and string are already declared and initialized for you. You must:

- Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
- Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.
- Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
    - Print the sum of `integer` plus your int variable on a new line.
    - Print the sum of `double` plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
    - Concatenate `str` with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
